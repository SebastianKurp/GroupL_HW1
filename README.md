Code is written in Python3. The code currently asks what report you would like to run and searches the files with the TryToOpen directory.
The option menu takes your integer input and gives that to an array as an index which returns a string which matches a key in a dictionary.
The value of the key is a regex search expression. This search expression is given to a method which searches the file for matches. If you
choose to run all reports it will simply run each key/value pair in the dictionary.

The main folder also includes some prelimary work with graphs which are undergoing revision as they are based off
notes from learning data structures in Python 2.7.
